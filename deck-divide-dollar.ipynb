    "A deck-based game is a mathematical game that has been transformed into a card game in which potential moves are limited to a set of cards drawn from a fixed deck <a name=\"a1\"></a>[[1](#AshlockSchonfeldCardGames)]. Each player must choose their strategy during each turn by selecting a card from their hand. Once chosen, the card is removed and cannot be played again.\n",

    "We will examine a deck-based version of the divide-the-dollar game. Divide-the-dollar is typically a simultaneous play (generalized Nash) game in which two players each make a bid to divide a dollar. If the sum of the bids is less than one, then each player gets to keep the amount of their bid <a name=\"a2\"></a>[[2](#BramsTaylor)]. We will look at an iterated, two-player, turn- and deck-based version of this in which we have multiple rounds of players taking turns playing the first card."
